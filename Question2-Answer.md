# What problems / warnings are there with code?


1. `setSelectedIndex` has been used incorrectly in the `WrappedListComponent`.In the `WrappedListComponent1`, the `setSelectedIndex` should be declared as a function that will set the selected index. Currently, it is being used as a variable, which will not update the state properly.

2. The `useState` hook returns an array with two elements, the current state and a function to update that state. In the current implementation, `setSelectedIndex` is assigned the function to update the state, but then it's being used as if it's the state value itself. The correct way to use `useState` would be to write `const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(null)`; instead.

3. The `isSelected` prop of the `WrappedSingleListItem` component is of type PropTypes.bool, but in the items.map call inside `WrappedListComponent`, it's being passed a value of `selectedIndex`, which is of type `PropTypes.number`. This could potentially cause a warning to be raised about a type mismatch.

4. The `items` prop of `WrappedListComponent` is defined as an array with an optional shape, but the syntax used to define the shape is incorrect.


5. The PropTypes definition for the items prop in WrappedListComponent is not correct.

6. In the `WrappedListComponent`, the `setSelectedIndex` variable name should be changed to `selectedIndex` to match the useState hook call.

7. The `onClickHandler` prop for the `WrappedSingleListItem` component is being called immediately with the `index` argument instead of passing a function that will be called when the item is clicked. This will result in the function being called every time the component is rendered, which is not the intended behavior. Instead, it should be passed as a function that takes the index as an argument and is only called when the item is clicked.

8. The items prop in `WrappedListComponent` is set to a default value of null, but this could lead to unexpected behavior if the component is used without providing the items prop. It would be better to set a default value of an empty array instead.

9. The `memo` HOC is used for both `SingleListItem` and `WrappedListComponent`, but it may not be necessary as these components are already relatively simple and not likely to cause unnecessary re-renders.
